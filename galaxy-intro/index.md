# Introduction to Galaxy

## 1. Overview
In this tutorial we will learn how to use the excellent tool [Galaxy](http://galaxyproject.org/) to analyze biological data [Galaxy](http://galaxyproject.org/) allows you to make use of a number of tools in a simple to use graphical interface (more on that in a moment). A user is thus not required to use any of the tools on the command-line (even though many of the integrated tools were developed for the command-line in the first place) but can fully use and control the integrated tools with the mouse pointer. On the flip side, it also allows developers of tools to easily integrate them into a graphical user interface system that is already known to many scientists and thus make the tools available for the research community. 

Another big advantage of [Galaxy](http://galaxyproject.org/) is that every step of the analysis is monitored and accessibly via a history. This makes reproducible research not only a possibility but also easy to facilitate. Steps from the history can be packaged into work-flows, which can be reused with  different data or shared with other scientists. [![GCC2015](gcc.png)](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/) [Galaxy](http://galaxyproject.org/) enjoys a large and growing user and developer base, which is evident by its own yearly [conference](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/) and participation in [Google Summer of Code](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Develop/GSOC/2015). It is relatively easy to find help should one need it, e.g. through their [mailing list](http://wiki.galaxyproject.org/MailingLists) or [wiki](http://wiki.galaxyproject.org/). Also, many commercial companies that provide next-generation sequencing services, provide Galaxy instances to analyze your data (e.g.  we at [New Zealand Genomics Limited](http://nzgenomics.co.nz) have a full fledged installation on our infrastructure ready for scientist to be used).

## 2. How to get access to Galaxy
There many option available to either give [Galaxy](http://galaxyproject.org/) a test run or do a full analysis with it. There is a ever growing list of public servers [available](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/PublicGalaxyServers), some of which might have certain restrictions, e.g. maximum data-file size, etc. The standard server is accessible at: [https://usegalaxy.org/](https://usegalaxy.org/)

You can start your own [Galaxy](http://galaxyproject.org/) instances on on [Cloud](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Cloud) infrastructure, e.g. [Amazon Cloud Services](http://aws.amazon.com/), should you have bigger analysis needs that you want to perform in the cloud.

You can [download](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Admin/GetGalaxy) and install [Galaxy](http://galaxyproject.org/) on you own machine or server, even integrating a computer cluster on the back-end.

You can install [BioLinux](http://environmentalomics.org/bio-linux/) on you own machine or run [BioLinux](http://environmentalomics.org/bio-linux/) as a virtual machine and you are set as well, as [Galaxy](http://galaxyproject.org/) comes pre-installed on [BioLinux 8](http://environmentalomics.org/bio-linux/).
